Skill points:
-No intermediate levels, just max.
-Once you buy a skill, you then also get a choice of skill upgrades
-Skill upgrades are unlocked at a higher level than the original skill level requirement.  Lower level skills have more slots.

Skill tree:
Skills are separated by tree and tier
You need one talent of the previous tier to get a talent of the next tier
Basic attacks are tier 0 and you start with them.

Problems to avoid:
-1 or max: You either buy or don't buy a skill, or they have diminishing returns
-Wasting points in early skills: late skills require Drive, so you need a mix of both

Drive:
In games with cooldowns, high level skills have high cooldowns.
Does not translate to the Drive system; high Drive require skills are necessary to have an incentive to build Drive.
-Drive require
-Drive consume skills are burst damage.  Build enemies to make burst damage worthwhile by giving them alternating periods of vulnerability.
-Stats scale with Drive.  Awakenings set you at -100 Drive, and make it harder to build Drive.  Mouseover the Drive bar should give you your bonus damage from Drive.
-Slow attacks that need to be combo'd into.

Character progress benchmarks:
-Awaken: should happen well before the end of the game, but after the middle.  The Awakening passive focuses on a single tree, so this is basically where you choose your class.
-Obtain legendary weapon: actually happens fairly early on, because your weapon grows with YOUR legend
-EX Skills: After awakening, this is your endgame progression
-Drive generation: Skills that used to generate Drive now generate more Drive, skills that didn't generate Drive now generate Drive, skills that consumed Drive are now free, etc.

Ghosts are more like passives; weak but always useful.
Grabs are mutually exclusive due to grab guard.
Slow attacks require combo linkers to be effective.
Your starting character is hard to mess up but recruitables have more room to be made weak.
As your character experiences personal growth, his/her max Drive goes up.

Highlights:
-Movement - White
-Skill preview - Green
-Incoming skill - Yellow
-Skill resolution - Red
-Mouseover highlight would be nice.  If field is active, but not being held, show a simple highlight where the mouse is.  Not a priority.
Highlights are mutually exclusive.  Unlocking movement stores the tiles to highlight on click.  Mousing over a skill passes the tiles to highlight, and these are displayed until the skill button loses focus.  Tiles passed from the caller take precedence over movement tiles.

-Click on a character: Goes to run(), so that player/enemy_panel can take the clicked character and set it.  Clicking the player panel's character during the Action phase changes its direction.
-Click on an empty tile: Can do it immediately, or go to run() for consistency
-Click and drag or zoom with wheel: Do it immediately; it has no gameplay effect whatsoever
-Click on a skill icon: Add to queue immediately for rapid Moonlight Slash spamming.  Make sure that all relevant functions get updated.  Also, queued skills show up in the bottom pane.
-Mouseover a skill icon: Go to run() so that the field can highlight the appropriate tiles.
-Click on the turn indicator: Go to run(), because a lot of stuff has to happen on turn changes.
